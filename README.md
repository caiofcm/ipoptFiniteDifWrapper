# Simple IPOPT wrapper using finite differences

This project uses ipopt for a simple optimization problem using finite differences to calculate the objective function gradient and the constraint jacobian.

[The optimization test case](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt_Tutorial "NLP Example")

## Tested on:

	- Windows 10 - mingw64

## TODO:

	- Test on debian
	- Check how the Ipopt was installed

*(Note: was used the newcppproject.sh to generate the Makefile)*
